## ✨ Features

- 📺 **Cinematic Video Player**: Large, center-aligned, aspect-ratio locked media container utilizing HLS.js and native iOS Safari player engines. Supports Picture-in-Picture (PiP), custom volume controls, double-tap seek, and auto-fallback muted play.
- 🚀 **SHA-256 Hash-Based IndexedDB Cache**: Caches the ~3MB channel database in the browser using IndexedDB. On every page load, it queries a lightweight `/api/iptv/channels/hash` endpoint (~80 bytes). If unchanged, channels load instantly from cache, saving bandwidth and eliminating player lag.
- 📂 **High-Speed BDIX FTP Portal**: An elegant `/ftp` directory showing local BDIX movie and media servers, complete with real-time online status indicators, host configurations, speed diagnostics, and instant redirection link components.
- 👥 **Real-Time Watcher Telemetry**: Relocated from the global header to the channel list header, using a non-blocking session heartbeat endpoint to monitor active viewers concurrently.
- 🌌 **3D CSS Net Background**: A highly optimized, static 3D perspective cyber grid with deep purple and cyan radial glows and a subtle viewport mesh overlay, designed for maximum performance (0% CPU/GPU overhead) on all devices.
- 🔍 **Interactive Channel Grid**: Filter and search through thousands of Bangla and international live TV channels in real-time. Responsive grid display dynamically adjusts for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- ⚡ **Full Skeleton UI Loading States**: Fully unified, custom-designed pulsing skeleton templates for every card element (Player, Details, Developer Info, Total Channels, and Channel List grid) to prevent layout shifts.
- 🧭 **Glassmorphic Sticky Header**: A clean, luxurious sticky header with brand identification and active live broadcast status.
- 🏆 **World Cup 2026 Announcement Popup**: A gorgeous, highly professional popup showcasing the official joint broadcasting rights (BTV, T Sports, Somoy TV) live in Bangladesh with custom high-contrast logo backdrops and ambient glowing animations.
- 🏎️ **Route Transition Optimizations**: Optimized static layout transitions, removing dynamic components to ensure instantaneous navigation between the player and the FTP directories.

- **JSON Format**:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHAJON-404/iptv/refs/heads/main/app/data/channels.json
  ```

- **M3U Playlist Format** (For Android TV, VLC, Kodi, or any IPTV Player):
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHAJON-404/iptv/refs/heads/main/app/data/channels.m3u

## 🛠️ M3U Playlist Converter

If you need the channel database in standard M3U format, you can use the built-in Node.js conversion script.

### Usage

1. **Quick Conversion** (using defaults: `app/data/channels.json` ➔ `app/data/channels.m3u`):
   ```bash
   npm run convert-m3u
   ```
   *Or run it directly:*
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js
   ```

2. **Custom Paths**:
   If you have a custom JSON database or want to output to a specific location:
   ```bash
   node scripts/json-to-m3u.js <path-to-input.json> <path-to-output.m3u>
   ```
